Task 5 â€“ Decision Trees and Random Forests
In this task, I used the Breast Cancer dataset to build and compare two machine learning models:
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
I trained both models, evaluated their performance, and visualized how the decision tree works. I also explored feature importance and used cross-validation to check model stability.

Key Learnings
Decision trees can easily overfit; random forests help avoid that.
Tree models are easy to interpret and visualize.
Feature importance helps identify what influences predictions the most.

Tools Used
Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas
